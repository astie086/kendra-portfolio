                        <p>
                            <br> My name is Kendra Herrera, growing up I have always pursued art as a passion and that hasn’t
                            changed. I want to be your Artist for your next project! After working for 10 years in customer
                            service in various market places I have always strived to make every customer happy in every
                            kind of situation. Now I’m starting my own company with the same attitude and positive energy
                            to my art design. I have created logo designs, graphic art, traditional art, story boards and
                            customized clothing in many art styles such as; stipple, Van Gogh style, Anime/Cartoon, and my
                            specialty realism. I live to create art in many shapes and forms.
                            <br>
                            <br> I specialize in realistic color portraits because of the challenge. I enjoy the attention
                            to detail that is required to make photo quality portraits come to life. This is where my passion
                            for art started, by pushing myself to get that much detail with a pen/pencil/charcoal/pastel/paint
                            and now graphic design. The smallest detail can make or ruin a portrait, that makes the finished
                            piece all that much more rewarding. These small things that I think are often taken for granted
                            or overlooked I find a humbling pleasure in bringing them to light. I believe it’s my love of
                            challenges I was able to thrust myself into graphic design. Using my photoshop/adobe experience
                            that I gained working for an e-commerce company, I have been able to create sleek and standout
                            designs for company logos and eye-catching illustrations for company website pages. Graphic Design
                            has given my art limitless capabilities and I’m excited to show it to the world.
                            <br>
                            <br> I can charm any creative media and I want to help you make your ideas come to life.
                            <br>
